## Install Instructions

 > Install requires Neovim 0.9+. Always review the code before installing a configuration.

Clone the repository and install the plugins:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:snuffop/Nvim ~/.config/snuffop/Nvim
NVIM_APPNAME=snuffop/Nvim/ nvim --headless +"Lazy! sync" +qa
```

Open Neovim with this config:

```sh
NVIM_APPNAME=snuffop/Nvim/ nvim

## Details 

Using Lazyvim to start with and many tweaks along the way. My Lua-fu is weak and I am working to get
better.
No Warranty Unless you're a used car.

Funny saying I heard the other day "Your Pizza's extended warranty is fine"

## Notes

- 2024 07 31 and now back to Obsidian again.. neorg is too immature yet.. I still don't like markdown but It's growing on me.
- 2024-07-14 Now Back to Neorg. Obsidian is too Mac ish to0 much (do it our way)
- 2024-06-12 Migration to obsidian again as neorg is still too immature for my workflow.

- Using Lua Function to obfuscate passwords.
- Pushed distant into disabled
- Learn Things about LSP setup of each language server!
- Using Lazyvim for the base config and reference
- I have been using Neovim for a few days, and I am getting to like it. I used Vim for years and
  Migrated to Spacemacs then Doom about 10 years ago. Now Neovim has a ton of new development and
  community involvement. Good to see
